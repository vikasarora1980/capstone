<B><h1> Coursera Data Science Capstone Project </h1></B>

The goal of this project is to create a product having a prediction algorithm and an accessible interface. It is split into two parts 

a. A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.

b. A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching the algorithm and app.
